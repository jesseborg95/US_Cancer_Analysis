# US Cancer Analysis
Group project using Python to analyze US Cancer Data between 2000 and 2016 inclusive. Exploratory data analysis, data mining and data cleaning.

## Motivation
I performed this project for my Intro to Data Mining class at The George Washington University. The requirements for the project were to perform exploratory data analysis and gain important information and insights, using a sizable dataset of your choice using Python.

## Data Source
I chose to analyze the US Cancer Data multiple a datasets obtained from the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/).

## Using the Files
The .csv files show the raw data used for the project. The crime data was too large, so I zipped it before uploading.
The .ipynb file shows all of my code. This file can be downloaded and ran to get the final output.
The .html file is the html version of my final report. Look at this if you are only interested in the output of the analysis. To view the html file, go to http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jesseborg95/Crime_In_DC_Analysis/blob/master/Crime_in_DC_Analysis.html
